    <p class="intro-text">We understand how to tell a story, how to differentiate to become
        memorable. To make people feel and connect with products,
        communities, and places. For over 25 years, across five continents,
        we have imagined, created, and nurtured images in people’s minds.
        Our understanding of visual language is deep. Our experience in
        branding and communication design has enabled us to create
        cohesive, flexible visual systems that work across multiple
        platforms, ensuring recognisability and long-term impact. We create
        brand identity, graphic design, and art direction for the industries
        of fashion, art, culture, and commerce. Good design stands at the
        crossroads of function and beauty. It engages, compels, and makes
        perfect sense. This is what we strive to give our clients at OOW. The
        journey to get there should be a revelatory and inspiring experience
        with strong relationships formed along the way. We observe and we
        listen until we understand: only then do we immerse ourselves in the
        creative challenge. Our process aims to unearth and communicate
        the intangible essence of a brand that people fall in love with. From
        its behaviour to its products; we believe every company has a story
        to tell and that design can be the most powerful way to tell it. Recent
        projects include retail graphics for global sportswear ON Running,
        a multiple location signage commission at Zürich Airport, an on–
        going art direction for a new travel industry magazine based out of
        Barcelona, and Vitra, SVT, OnceMore by Södra to name a few.
